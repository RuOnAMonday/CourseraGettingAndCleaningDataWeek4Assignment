### CourseraGettingAndCleaningDataWeek4Assignment
Week 4 assignment for coursera Getting And Cleaning Data

This project consists of:

1) The Code Book that describes all the data variables
2) The readme file with a general description (that you are reading now)
3) A file named run_analysis.R that has all the code for the assignment.
This is a set of code that loads text files and manipulates it to output a text file, which is also attached here.
In this file, we read the text files, combine data sets and rename columns and rows to make the data more descriptive. We then select a subset of columns based on means and standard deviations. Finally we calculate averages based on ActivityName and Subject (refer code book for variable descriptions).
4) A text file named tidydata.txt with the final output from the manipulation in run_analysis.R
